            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or a while after the Goſpell was freely preached in England there were but two ſortes of people not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>h neither in the manners of their life, nor in the matter of their beleefe they deſerued ſo honorable a title. But the looſenes of the times ſithence hath bene ſuch, for want of correction of manners, that there are now diuerſe ſectes, wherof I wil touch one eſpecially, a third ſort which are of no religion, named Atheiſtes. A people without God hauing no feeling of God, nor knowledge of their owne horrible ſtate. * Neither here nor cold; neither feeling their<note place="margin">Reuel. 3. 15</note> owne miſery nor regarding their owne ſhame. Of which wicked ſort the nomber is now greatter in diuers landes then both of Papiſtes and Proteſtantes. And they are ſo much worſe and more peſtiferous then the Papiſtes, as they faine to bee of all religions, as occaſion and company may ſerue their turne. And yet indeede are of no religion at all.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Papiſtes religion is more pleaſing vnto the carnall ſences of man, then the ſtrait rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is no doubt but they will ioyne with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes againſt the Proteſtantes when any ſtirre happeneth for religion: Which God forbid if it bee his holv will.</p>
            <p>Therefore if ſuch monſterous cloudes of Satans ſleightes did not preſently hang ouer our heads, and therewithall ſuch ſtinking miſtes of horrible iniquity encloſe vs round aboute: euen readie to choake all our ſences. (Satan therby endeuouring to ſeperate vs from God and his holy woord) it might ſeeme too too curious a queſtion to aske: is there a

            <p>And therefore ſeeing men regard not to maintaine that fyre of true zeale which the Lord himſelfe willed to burne in mens hartes. There are great likelihodes by many conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, that God will ſhortly kindle the fyre of diſturbance, and in the end conſume his enemies. For euen now the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of God ſpeaketh vnto the diuers ſtates, as hee did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the congregations of the Laodicians, ſaying: * let him that hath an eare heare what the ſpirit ſayth vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches A men the true &amp; faithful witnes, euen the beginning of the Creatures of God, ſayth theſe thinges: I know your woorkes that yee are neither cold nor hote, I would yee wer cold or hote: ſo then becauſe yee are lukewarme end neither cold nor hote, I will ſpew you out of my mouth: becauſe ye ſay, I am ritch and encreaſed with goods and need nothing, and you know not that yee are wretched, miſerable, poore, blind, and naked.</p>
            <p>Therefore I counſell you to buy of mee Gold tried in the fyre, that yee may bee ritch, and white raiment that yee may bee clothed that your filthy nakednes do not appeare. And annoint your eies with eie ſalue that yee may ſee. As many as I loue I rebuke and chaſten, be feruent therefore,
<pb facs="tcp:8754:5"/> and repent ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Behold I ſtand at the dore and knocke, if any man heare my voice and open the dore: I will come in vnto him, and ſuppe with him, and hee with mee: To him that ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth will I graunt to ſit with mee in my throne, as I haue ouercome and ſitte with my Father in his throne.</p>
            <p>By this let them that haue eares heare what the Spirite ſaieth to the congregations. They are monſtrous may med bodies, that want eares to heare the woord of God, and yet haue eares doing their office in hearing all other thinges.</p>
            <p>Now where the fault lyeth of this wauering zeale, this dulnes in hearing, this lukewarmnes in following, this ſlow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in beleeuing and exerciſing the word of God, or who deſerueth the blame thereof I leaue that in queſtion.</p>
            <p>For to be an accuſer of crimes is perillous, namely wher the Iudges want vpright hearing, there it is not only a loſt labor and thankles office: but alſo obtaineth vnwoorthy blame and hatred for good wil.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I ſay an accuſation may bee made in Chriſtian charity for the amendment of ſuch as walke inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly, whereupon I ſay (proue it as I can) that euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is bound by duty to bee an eie and an eare to the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to declare vnto him in chriſtian charitie the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he ſeeth among the people, becauſe he can ſee no further then a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> except god do inſpire ſom ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with more vertue that way the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly is in men. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falts be told the magiſtrats for charity ſake &amp; duty to god, thoſe perſons haue diſcharged the duty of good Chriſtians: And then if the maieſtrates do not trie out the truth &amp; execute iuſtice, the ſinne is vpon him. Therfore in praier I humbly beſeech the almighty God for his dear ſons ſake to ſend his holy Spirite into the hartes of all, that euen from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that ſittes in the roiall throne, vnto the loweſt and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt in whole kingdoms &amp; dominions, that euery one may remember, that the ende of their creation both in body &amp; ſoule is to glorify God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8754:6"/>
            <p>And therfore let euery one that deſireth ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> endeuour now themſelues to walke vprightly and deale truly, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly and faithfullie in their vocation: &amp; pray hartily to God in this time of vrgent neceſſity, that the feruent zeale of Gods moſt ſacred ſeruice, according to his owne word may be ſurelie engrafted in the hartes of all, and moſt chiefly in Princes, counſellers, Nobilitie magiſtrates and officers. That the ſame true zeale, and the vertue thereof may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from them by degrees in good example into the harts of the commons, euen to the pooreſt and baſeſt ſubiectes. That all with one found minde may praiſe the holy and dreadfull name of Iehoua; the moſt glorious, almighty, and eternall God; the onely Monarch of Heauen and Earth, &amp; that in the name of Chriſt Ieſus, for whoſe ſake our praiers are pleaſant and acceptable vnto him, for otherwiſe he can not abide nor brooke them.</p>
            <p>As King Dauid was moued and ſollicited doubtles by holy motions which were in him the woorke of the holy<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 1 Chron. 17 &amp; 22.</note> Ghoſt, to build a Temple vnto the mighty God of Iſraell, which when hee had purpoſed to doe, and prepared much coſtly ſtuffe for the building: Nathan the Prophet warned him to the contrary, God would not haue it of his dooing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And why? Euen becauſe of his bloody handes. Therefore hee commaunded to leaue it to his ſon Salomon: by whoſe innocent handes, God would haue that moſt famous and glorious figure wrought, before Satan ſhould corrupt his vnderſtanding &amp; leade him captiue for a time: as afterward hee did in moſt ſhamefull wife: as in the 11. of 2. booke of Kinges. Euen ſo I by like motions from time to time, haue bin and am continually ſollicited to meditate vppon Gods Monarchie; and the Deuils Kingdome: But whether the Lord worke in mee to the end I may rightly frame and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, and time to finiſh the ſame to the benefite of his Church, becauſe of my bloudy handes and ſinnes of my youth, the Lord Ieſus knoweth and not I.</p>

            <p>Men ought to examine al doctrines by the word of God and chiefly conſider what is ſpoken or written, and not ſo much regarde the ſpeaker or writer.

Therefore of neceſſity it muſt followe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, or to what end ſoeuer, things are by him created, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, encreaſed or diminiſhed, or by Angels or men, in deed or word committed, or in thought conceaued, yea euen by Satan and his Angells: they all haue their mouing, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of working by his forepointment and direction only.</p>
               <p>This concluſion cannot iuſtly bee denied: except another power be imagined, that of it ſelfe can bee, moue, worke, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and direct thinges beſides and contrary to the power and will of this Almighty and eternall Monarch of all power and dominion, by which falſe &amp; vile imagination the almightines of our one eternall God to bee creator, &amp; director of all things viſible and inuiſible ſhould bee vtterly denied.

               <p>For if hee had ſhewed mercy on all: then had he hidden in himſelfe, halfe his glory: for euery thing is beſt diſcerned by his contrary: Therefore the eternall vertue, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite comfort, and the moſt pleaſaunt fruicte of Gods mercy, could neuer haue beene ſo precious and comfortable to Gods elect: except it had beene matched with a contrary vertue, as infinite, great, as excellent, and as much to be prayſed as it ſelfe: euen Gods iuſtice in generall: but eſpecially on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked reprobate.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth how it pleaſed God to make for his owne purpoſe, to ſhew foorth his wonderfull power, a Theater or ſtage, for the inhabitaunts of Heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Earth and Hell, to behold his vnſpeakable woorkes, and ordained the meanes and matter to work on, how euery thing ſhould come to his forepointed ende: And that was and is, ſome to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and ſome to damnation, and all both for to ſhew foorth his own glory purpoſed in himſelfe before the world was, and to ſhew himſelfe vnto all three regiments, Heauen, Earth, Hell, to Angels, Deuils and mankind, to bee the almighty, eternall, and moſt glorious God of mercy and iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Oh that men would therefore feare him and ſubmit their willes to his will, becauſe he is the chiefe Monarch, of all in all, will they, nill they.</p>
               <p>This is that very true God, whom all the holy and noble Patriarches, from the beginning did ſerue and honor before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8754:10"/> the general flood, with ſuch ſacrifices as were then allowed of, vntill wickednes did ſo abound, (as in theſe our dayes) that God was (as it were) compelled to deſtroy by water: and ſeemed to begin the world anew.</p>
               <p>This is that moſt leuing God, that cannot forget ſuch as loue &amp; feare him. * For when he was to execute iuſtice vpon<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.</note> the vniuerſall world, hee prouided for his ſeruant Noah, commaunding him 120. yeares before to make the Arke in readines for ſafegard of him and his: whereas all others for infidelitie, pride, and diſobedience with other horrible and filthy ſinnes periſhed by water.</p>
               <p>The like kindnes he ſhewed vnto his ſeruant Lot, when he by fire and brimſtone from Heauen deſtroyed Sodome and Gomorah, with other Cities. And to all the Godly from age to age hee hath ſhewed like grace and mercy: and greater to ſome, by ſo much as the Goſpell ſurmounteth the law in goodnes towards Gods elect.</p>
               <p>This is that God * that thoſe Abraham for a cheefe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 12.</note> made him of counſell what hee would doe to Sodome and Gomorah: hee made him alſo his friend &amp; chiefe member of his viſible Church on Earth: and gaue him this honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble title: the father of beleeuers, of whoſe ſeed the promiſed Meſſias by a lineall diſcent, came into the world in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, to ſaue ſo many of the damned ſeed of Adam, as God before the world was, had elected to bee ſaued by the death and riſing againe * of that vnſpotted Lambe Chriſt Ieſus ſtain from the beginning in his own perſon by Gods<note place="margin">Reuel. 13. 8.</note> eternal decree &amp; forepointment, &amp; alſo * in his elect members.</p>
               <p>This is the ſame glorious maieſtie, that hath created the Heauen, and the Heauen of Heauens, with all the heauenly bodies. And alſo hell with fiery tormentes, the Sky, the Sun, the Mone, the Starres, the Sea, and the Earth, with al their contentes: &amp; laſt of all man according to his owne y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and for his owne purpoſe and eternall glory.</p>
               <p>Euerlaſting praiſes be vnto this moſt holy and glorious<note place="margin">Pſal. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore wee ought to learne of Dauid to anſwere the wicked, when in ſkorne they aſke where is God: wee may ſay our God is in Heauen, and doth euery where what pleaſeth him. Hee is there accompanied with his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and ſoules of his elect, in ſuch pleaſant reſt &amp; quiet feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: as no fleſhly eie hath or can ſee, no eare hath hard it told, becauſe no tongue is ſufficient to expreſſe it, nor learning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſribe it, no cunning with pen or penſel able to paint it out, no thought ſtrong ynough to imagine, nor fleſhly hart woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to conceaue it. Saint Iohn in his reuelation hath ſaid ſo much to blaze and declare the glorious ioy of this almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eternall God (which hee will giue to his elect in the world to come) as is poſſible for man to ſpeake, write, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and yet farre of from that it is indeede. * For we<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13 12.</note> ſee in this world, as it were but through a glaſſe, nothing perfectly, but the time will come when wee ſhall ſee God face to face. This euerlaſting Monarch and almighty Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houa is all in al, and onely may bee ſaid to bee: For none but hee can iuſtly ſay without addition: I am: and why? Euen becauſe hee onely, I meane God, hath his being in, of, and by himſelfe, and all other creatures in, of, for, from, and by him alone. There was neuer none of Adams lyne (except the holy Ghoſt wrought in him to that end) that could attaine to the true knowledge of this almighty and onely Monarch.</p>
               <p>The heathen Philoſophers ſaw a far of an vnknown thing, which they very well perceiued, to bee the cauſe of all other cauſes, &amp; firſt moouer of all that moueth: further knowledge they could not get by al the wiſedome and cunning of men.</p>
               <p>Therfore it is moſt true * that the wiſedome of this world<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1 20.</note> is fooliſhnes with God: And contrarywiſe, worldly wiſe men, not yet new borne by the holy Ghoſt, eſteeme the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the Goſpel very fooliſhnes in compariſon of their owne wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Therefore they cannot attaine to the true knowledge and

               <p>Theſe woords (Satan and deuil) ſignify welnigh one thing: that is to ſay, an aduerſary, enemy, or an accuſer, which was once the good creature of God, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And all that notwithſtanding, God hath giuen to Satan, ſuch an vnſpeakable power to impugne and reſiſt his owne woorkes and goodnes euery way: as is not fully to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by the wiſedome and reaſon of man: and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bee expreſſed of any, albeit God hath geuen elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſome men abundantly. For as God is a ſpirit, euen ſo ſatan is a ſpirite. And as * God hath his inuiſible holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits<note place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 25. 31</note> called his Angels: euen ſo ſatan hath his inuiſible vnholy ſpirits * called his angels But as God is the moſt holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible<note place="margin">25. 41.</note> Spirite, and omnipotent, of him ſelfe able to doe all thinges: euen ſo contrary wiſe Satan the deuill, is the moſt vnholy, filthy, inuiſible ſpirit, and vtterly impotent of him ſelfe, vnable to doe any thing. For albeit hee hath free will in his naturall wickednes: yet hee hath no power of him ſelfe to execute his miſchieuous luſt, except where, when, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom God alone hath forepointed him.</p>
               <p>This accuſer Satan, as Captayne of an army, with an infinite nomber of his adherentes, called his angels (being then in equall ſtate for the time, with the holy Angels:) through infidelitie, pride, and diſobedience, became rebels: which was that * iniquity that God found among his Angels.<note place="margin">Iob 4. 18. &amp; 15. 15. 1 Pet. 24.

Agayn, * the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate &amp;c. God hath reſerued them in euerlaſting chaynes of darkneſſe, vnto the iudgement of the great day.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth how ſome of Gods Angels became his enemies, and deuils: whereof there are infinite nombers. For * if one mad man had a hole leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8754:12"/> worlde which paſſe their liues indeueliſh madnes as though there were no God. <hi>Rom. 11. 32. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therfore we may cry with Paule: Oh the vnſpeakable &amp; paſſing wonderfull deipnes of the ſecrets of God, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his iudgements, &amp; his wayes paſt finding out.</p>
               <p>Now of this infinite nomber of wicked ſpirits there is one that ſeemeth to be principall, and all the reſt are his Angels, for whom * euerlaſting hell fire was prepared. Hee is called<note place="margin">Mart. 25 41. 12. 24. 2 Reg. 1. 2. &amp; 9. 11. Reuel. 12. 1.</note> by diuers names, as * Belzebub prince of the Deuils.</p>
               <p>Belzebub * was the God of Ecron, In the hiſtory of Tobias is mencioned a deuil called Aſmodeus. * He is called Abaddon King of Locuſts, Hornets and ſuch lyke horrible flyes. Alſo hee is named the Angell of the bottomleſſe pitt, and the great dragon which with his Angels fought agaynſt Michaell and his Angels: But that Michaell Chriſt Ieſus was to ſtrong for him, for this dragon euen this olde ſerpent called the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and Satan, which deceaueth all the world, had no more place in heauen, but was caſt out. * And the ſonne of God<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 18.</note> him ſelfe ſayeth. I ſaw Satan fall from Heauen like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It ſufficeth that Chriſt Ieſus ſaw him fall, though he tell not what yeare and day. * He is alſo called the God of this worlde. And did take vpon him like a God, * when hee would<note place="margin">2 Corin. Mart. 4. 9. Epheſ. 2. 2.</note> haue had Chriſt Ieſus fal down &amp; worſhip him. He is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> * Prince that ruleth the ayre: euen the ſpirit that euer hath, doth now, and euer ſhall work in the children of diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that as God is the imperiall Monarch of all power and dominion: Euen ſo hath hee giuen a kingdome (for the accompliſhment of his eternall purpoſe) to his enemie and hangman Satan. For * if Satan be deuided agaynſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 10.</note> how ſhall his kingdom ſtand? <hi>ergo</hi> Satan hath a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a time.

               <p>And this muſt ſtand of neceſſitie, that the creation of Angels,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8754:12"/> and fall of Satan and his trayne, was before the creation of mankinde: for otherwiſe, this enemie, this naturall murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, could not haue bene ſo redy in the ſerpent doing his office to bring mankind to confuſion imediatly after his creation, as to mee ſeemeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>* Therfore God is called the father of ſpirites, which were<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 9.</note> created, and ſome of them fallen from bleſſed ſtate, before he created man, for neyther angels nor men, can keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from falling, if God keepe them not. And as the ſame God is almighty eternall and without beginning or ending: ſo hath he purpoſed in himſelfe before the world was, that he would make both angels and men, * ſome to honour and ſome<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 21</note> to diſhonour, to ſhewe himſelfe to bee the glorious God of mercy and Iuſtice. The Lord hath made all things for his<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 4.</note> owne cauſe: yea euen the wicked for the day of diſtruction.

               <p>For angels thus, Saynt Paule preſcribing orders in the<note place="margin">Election and reiection of Angels.</note> Church hath theſe wordes to Tymothy. * I charge thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his elect angels, that thou obſerue theſe thinges without partialitye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8754:19"/> of neceſſity, that where &amp; when Angels were elected, there alſo &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> angels were reiected. For of contraries there is euer a contrary reaſon, and therfore where choſing is, there is alſo refuſing of them that bee not choſen: But God elected ſome angels, the conſequent is, hee reiected other ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for if hee had preſerued all and let none fall from him, then had there bene no election at all, neyther any deuill: but ſome hee choſe and ſome hee refuſed. And iniquity (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">Iob</note> * Iob ſpeaketh) was found in thoſe which he had refuſed: by which fall of angels it is manifeſt that they had a lawe or precept which they tranſgreſſed, otherwiſe they coulde not haue committed iniquitie: It is Saynt Paule his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:<note place="margin">Ro. 14. 15. 2 Pet. 2. 4.</note> * where no lawe is, there is no tranſgreſſion. But Saynt Peter ſayth. * God ſpared not the angels that ſinned: <hi>Ergo</hi> they had a lawe or precept, which they brake: otherwiſe they could not haue ſinned.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth that God hath delt with angels as with men, concerning creation, election and reiection, ſauing that all angels ſinned not, as all mankinde ſinned in Adam, for wee reade not of the redemption of angels as of the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of mankind, ſo many as it pleaſed God to chooſe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
               <p>So then, hee created both angels and men as the cheefe parte of his works, purpoſed in him ſelfe to ſet forth his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power, honor and glory. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For if they had not had that choyce in themſelues (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence be it ſayde) God could not with iuſtice haue puniſhed theyr diſobedience: But God can do nothing vniuſtly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had moſt iuſtly puniſht the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing fore poynted which and how many ſhould by his grace ſtand to ſerue him in theyr firſt purity: the reſt he left to them ſelues, which through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,

               <p>Thus it pleaſed God to make iuſt matter vnto himſelfe to exerciſe both mercy and iuſtice, which two moſt excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues do chiefly magnifie and extol his eternall power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which to haue knowen and prayſed is his chiefe ſcope.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8754:21"/> and true zeale of Gods ſeruice.</p>
               <p>And whatſoeuer vertue there is: there is alſo a vice, his contrary and ſo of euery thing from the beginning: Firſt of Angels, the good agaynſt the euill: ſecondly of men, the elect agaynſt the reiect, the wicked agaynſt the godly, brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt brother, Cain agaynſt Abell, Iſmael agaynſt Iſaack, Eſau agaynſt Iacob, Pharao agaynſt Moſes, a falſe God agaynſt the true God, a falſe Chriſt againſt the true Chriſt. For all vertues and vices are contrary.</p>
               <p>And wee ſee that God in creating all thinges, hath made each creature in theyr kyndes, and one mortal enemie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer of another: for what thing ſoeuer driueth feare into an other thinge: is enemie to the thinge that conceaueth the feare. Example</p>
               <p>The Wolfe to the Sheepe, the Firret and Wezell to the ſilly Conny, the Cat to the Mouſe, the Spider to the Flye, are natural deuourers. And likewiſe of al maner beaſtes and wormes on Earth: And whatſoeuer of them: the ſame of the foules of the ayre, and fiſhes in the waters both ſalt and freſh. Finally the ſame in effect is Satan and his adherents both bodily and ghoſtly to Gods elect while they remayne on Earth.</p>
               <p>So that euery creature liuing, hath by natures ordinance, as ſome ſpeake, which is in deede Gods prouidence, a mortall enemie and deuourer: for as the Wolfe is to the Sheepe: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo in efect is Satan to mankinde: And all theſe hath this almighty God of nature wrought to ſet foorth his owne glory to Angels and men, namely to ſhew him ſelfe to bee, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull God of mercy and Iuſtice.</p>

               <p>The almighty Monarch of Heauen, and earth, is not only the creator of all creatures but alſo the high lawe geuer, for euery kinde of creature, in thoſe regiments: So as before I conclude, God himſelfe is not ſubiect to any lawe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot do euill.

And in all theſe workes Satan doth but his kinde as euery liuing thing in his kinde doth as nature compelleth them.</p>

               <p>And although the whole world is altogeather ſet on wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.</note> yet Gods Maieſty is neyther endomaged nor trobled thereby.

               <p>And albeit he hath ordeined rewards for weldoing, &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for il doing: yet man by weldoing brings God no profit nor hindraunce by ill doing. For the good and euil that man doth, redoundeth to himſelfe, for the good that man doth hee deſerueth nothing, becauſe it commeth not of himſelfe: but the holy Ghoſt worketh it in him: And yet by grace hee<note place="margin">Luc. 17. 10.</note> receiueth the rewarde, as though it came of himſelfe. * For when wee haue done all the good that is poſſible for vs to do, wee ſhall yet be founde vnprofitable ſeruantes towards God, becauſe wee do not that which the lawe comaundeth.

               <p>And for theſe cauſes, God did execute his forethreatened ſentence vppon Adam and his poſterity.

               </p>
               <p>And yet Satan told them truth in one thing, as is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe of his miniſters in this Worlde, to mixe truth with falſhed, the rather to make his lies take place. For in eating the forbidden fruicte, they knew euil: whereas before they knew but good only.

               <p>Beholde it is a doble fault, not only to do euill, but alſo to fauour them that do euill. Yet ſuerly that is the nature of wicked folkes of what degree ſo euer: euen to fauour ſuch vices in others, as are in themſelues.

               <p>Alſo this example proueth that God moueth, appoynteth, and directeth ſome tyme the euill ſpirits to ſeaze vpon ſuch as neglect to feare, loue and to obay him: to puniſh theire former ſinnes, by making them afterwares to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit greater euills: As King Saul did afterwards in aſking counſell, and ſeeking helpe of Witches, Enchaunters, and Sorcerers, when the ſpirit of the good Lord was gone from him.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:8754:31"/>
               <p>Thus we ſee by that which was done to king Saul, king Ahab and others mentioned in holy Scriptures, that men are moued, led, and gouerned often by euill ſpirits.

               <p>And this is moſt true, that all the euilles committed in thoughtes, woordes and deedes, being moſt filthye and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable, before God and his elect, as well Angels as men: done by Satan and his adherentes bodily and ghoſtly they haue neuertheleſſe, their being, moouing, diſpoſition, and woorking from the power of God, and are forepoynted, and limitted by him, for the accompliſhment of his eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

               <p>As Iudas for example beinge of the twelue Apoſtles, hee<note place="margin">Mark. 3. 14</note> did his office, hee preached the goſpel, hee wrought miracles, hee ſeemed outwardly as honeſt, as faythful, and as holy as the reſt, * yea and more zealous then his fellowes, and yet a<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. 5.</note> very hipocrite, which argueth that euen now among thoſe that preach the goſpell &amp; miniſter the holy ſacramentes there may bee ſuch Hipocrites as Iudas was.

               <p>And by thoſe Hipocrites as well of the Spiritualty as of the Laity many of the very elect are abuſed and enticed to the committing of horrible Crimes manifeſted vnto men. God ſeruing therein his eternall ſecrete purpoſe by the miniſtery of Satan to the end that none ſhould be able to iudge of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets (in the matter of election and reprobation) who ſhoulde be ſaued or damned further then hee hath giuen ſcoape by the

               <p>Moreouer this peſtilent vice of Hipocriſy, is ſuch a canker in the nature of mankind as cannot bee ſhunned nor auoyded. And by it both the elect and the reiect couer their ſinnes from the knowledge of man (but not from God) and priuily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly abuſe themſelues in body mynd and Soule. And ſome cary cloſe their filthines but ſhort tyme. Some keepe it long vnſeene of man, Yet in ſome at length it breaketh foorth to their vtter ſhame, whereof ſome by Gods grace returne by repentance and receaue ſaluation becauſe they are the elect of God. Some through hardnes of hart caſt aſyde all ſhame and feare of God, and ſo runne headlong into deſtruction, &amp; damnation.

               <p>Is not this a moſt ſpeciall grace of God, to couer ſome mens ſins that they neuer come to light? haue they not great and iuſt cauſe to bee thankfull, ſeeing no creature can accuſe them, but God and their owne conſcience.

               <p>Vnleſſe ſome madde man would ſay, that perhaps ſome thing done vnknowen or vnwares to God, which were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his almightines: but all thinges are poſſible with God, and of him euery thing hath being, mouing, power, &amp; diſpoſition of woorking, be it good or euill in reſpect of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for in regard that al that is commeth from God, all is good: euen that which euill ſpirites worke towardes mankinde, for as much as they worke not otherwiſe then God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, for the accompliſhment of his eternall purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore whatſoeuer God doth by the working of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites good or ill, is euery way good, and no degree to be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med euill. For although he commaund man not to kil man: yet may God deſtroy millions of millions without checke of any, and geue lyfe againe at his pleaſure: But why he doth this or that, or what hee meaneth by theſe or thoſe his ſecrete workes, ther ought no queſtions bee made further then is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by holy Scriptures: but with all humble obedience, let vs ſubmit our ſelues to his bleſſed will reuealed in his word: and with all reuerence let vs honor the ſecrets of his will vnreuealed: And here withall let vs liue in all dutiful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his holy law, for otherwiſe we hope for mercy in vayne. And yet I ſay * that by the workes of the Law no fleſh<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> ſhall bee iuſtifyed.</p>
               <p>The iuſtice of God which hee executeth by the miniſtery of Satan and his angels, as good, as holy, as much to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and magnifyed, as his ſweete mercy in Chriſt Ieſus, in God they are equall: Therefore it pleaſed God in the ſecret counſell of his own will, for his eternall purpoſe decreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was: to forepoint matter whereon to beſtowe iuſtice and mercye: And all to magnify his holy name and ſhew foorth his owne glory. Yet is it not lawfull for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings and Princes ouer nations to ſeeke their own glory: for as they are commaunded in generall to ſeeke &amp; ſet
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8754:49"/> foorth the glory of God, but how they doe hee beſt knoweth, that is forepoynted to audice their accomptes.</p>
               <p>And although Satan and his trayne both bodily &amp; ghoſtly do euermore deuiſe miſchiefe as is their nature for they can not doe otherwiſe: yet God as often as pleaſeth him, turneth their wicked purpoſes the contrary way. As when Ioſeph his brethren, by Satans working in ſome of them, did ſeeke to kill the poore Innocent, the holy ghoſt wrought in other ſome of them, to withſtand that wicked purpoſe: and when ſome of them had executed their malice, by ſelling him into Egypt for a ſlaue, becauſe hee was ſo dearly beloued of his father they hated him, their malicious entent was neuer to haue ſeene him agayne. And yet it pleaſed God to turne their mallice and ſpitefull wicked entent to goodnes vppon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 5. 8</note> * as Ioſeph told them when he made himſelfe knowne vnto them, yea Ioſeph denied it to bee their deede and ſayde playnly it was the woorke of God and not theirs. And yet it is moſt true, they did it in hatred by Satans working in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If wee marke the courſe of holy Scriptures &amp; deuour mens writinges on the ſame, wee ſhall finde it manifeſt that euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, the holy ghoſt hath euer wrought in thoſe whom God hath choſen to their ſaluation. And Satan and his Angels in thoſe whom God hath left vnchoſen, euer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to their damnation: And the ſame ſeueral working ſhall continue vnto the ende of this world: for as in euery kingdome vertuous or vitious folks are in auctority: the common weale for religion frameth accordingly.

               <p>Fourthly, with a mighty blaſt of wynde, he threw downe the houſe vppon his Sonnes and Daughters, and kild them all: ſo much as God gaue into his power, ſo much hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deuoured according to his tyrannous nature. And yet very ill content that hee could not touch Iobs perſon: which at length hee gaue into his power ſauing his life.</p>
               <p>And what ſayeth the Text? Satan went foorth from the preſence of the Lord, and ſmote Iob with ſore byles from the ſoale of the foote vnto the crowne of the head. Note it wel, he went foorth from the preſence of the Lord to doe thoſe things.</p>
               <p>For by this hiſtory of Iob it appeareth that deadly enemies, Theeues, the fyer, and the tempeſtious windes were Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans inſtrumentes by God his ſufferance to afflict Iob and to try his fayth: whom neuertheleſſe God himſelfe commendeth for an vpright iuſt man fearing God &amp; eſchewing euil: whoſe witnes is very ſufficient to approue the honeſty of man.</p>
               <p>Now if the opinions of Heathen Philoſophers, and ſome called Chriſtians bee true, that the corruption of the ayre, commes by concurrences and influences of the planets and ſignes, and of their diſtemperature commes murrians, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilences, botches, blaynes, burning feuers, and other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: then it ſhould ſeeme by their opinion, that thoſe inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible creatures worke of themſelues, and caſt foorth their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes at a venture here and there, without Gods forepoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which to graunt is a great abſurdity and derogation of Gods almightines.</p>
               <p>Yea there are verie many men that haue their wittes ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with fancies of Aſtrologie and Aſtronomie (that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8754:50"/> they wil take on them to giue a naturall reaſon for the ſecret workes of God, as though they were ſubiect to mans corrupt ſences.

               <p>By the ſtory it appeareth that ſatan the God of this world, and Prince that ruleth in the ayre, hath the handling at God his appoyntment of all thoſe thinges to execute Gods iuſtice: ſo hath hee lykewyſe of the ſwoord with all engins and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for wars whenſoeuer they are abuſed in any euil cauſe: For in euery controuerſie right ſtryueth agaynſt wrong, and wrong agaynſt right. So hath it bene from the beginning, is now, &amp; ſhall continue to the end of the world: And whoſoeuer mayntayneth the wrong cauſe, is led and guyded by Satan, yea though hee winne the field.</p>
               <p>So that whenſoeuer any thing is done ſuch as men cal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce, miſfortune, ill lucke, miſchiefe or what ſoeuer: whereby any of mankinde is hurt in bodie or goods, eyther by warres, by fyre, water, ſtorme or tempeſt, heate of the Sunne, cold of the Moone, conſtellation of the Starres, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Planets, corruption of the ayre, dampe of the Earth, the abundance of Snow, the extremity of froſt, the want of Rayne, or too much wet, the fury of beaſtes, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim of Serpentes, or what ſoeuer elſe: whereby God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth a people or nations in generall, or ſome in particuler, for ſinne or other cauſe onely knowne to himſelfe: all is done by Gods almighty power and forepoyntment, Satan being his inſtrument and executioner, when it pleaſeth God to vſe him.</p>
               <p>Thus appeareth that Satan and his angels are Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes to execute his iuſtice, where, when, and vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſeth God to appoint.</p>

               <p>Not that Satan can deſire to ſerue God, or hath any zeale to doe iuſtice, for hee is as naturall an enemy to mankynde, as the Wolfe to the Sheepe, the Catte to the Mouſe, &amp;c. But God vſeth his naturall malice vnknowne to him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his iuſtice. And although that Satan is called the God of this Worlde, and Prince that ruleth in the ayre, yet hee hath not the Elimentes planets and ſignes to vſe otherwiſe then God hath forepoynted.</p>
               <p>Neither doth hee knowe that hee ſerueth Gods holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for theſe as incencible, &amp; ignorant of Gods ſecrets as a dogge of mans ſecrets.

For true fayth can bee no more without good workes, then the Sunne without light, or the fyre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heate.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee that mankinde is deuided in two ſorts, ſome to ſaluation, ſome to damnation: the reprobate are damned through their owne default for their iuſt deſertes: the elect are ſaued through Gods mere mercy in Chriſt Ieſus, not for their owne deſertes. So was his good pleaſure to doe with his owne: And it is more then mere madnes to argue why he hath done this or that. * There is written ſufficiently to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere<note place="margin">Exo. 33. 19. Rom. 9. 10. &amp;c.</note> all curious queſtions whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe thinges ſeeme ſtrange, hard, rigorous, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and agaynſt reaſon in ſome mens iudgementes: let them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trouble their heads with muſing on the matter, for it wil
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8754:59"/> not helpe: but rather with all humility, let them returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true obedience of this incomprehenſible, this euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, this almighty, and paſſing woonderfull Godhed.</p>
               <p>And although men cannot obſerue the Law, yet let them confeſſe it to bee moſt righteous: let them loue it, let them put all their care and deſire to obſerue and keepe it: let them bee ſory when they breake it: thereunto let them adde, true &amp; holy obedience to God the Father: ſtedfaſt and true fayth, feare and loue in Chriſt Ieſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> crauing alwayes the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the holy ghoſt, not truſting any thing in their owne ſtrength or good woorkes. And they that are thus affected may certainly and without doubt aſſure themſelues that God hath choſen them to ſaluation, and made them ioynt heires of his kingdome, in and with his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, the right heire thereof, and elder Brother of all the children of God.</p>
               <p>And thoſe whom God hath forechoſen and forepoynted to bee ſaued, can not periſh by any meanes, neither ſhall they liue careſſe in the world, for they ſhall feare to do euill ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhall not dare in hope of forgiuenes, ſo to tempt God as doe the reprobate: for the holy Spirite which is appointed to guyde them * ſhall checke their conſciences continually by<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 16. 9. 1. 1. 11.

               <p>* And all the promiſes of God are in him, yea and amen for<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20. Pſal. 146. 6.

               <p>Not that God can repent, or bee ſorie as men are when thinges come contrary to their willes: For what ſoeuer is done by Satan, and by him in mankinde, God might let if it were his wil: to mankind happeneth many thinges vnaware: it is not ſo to God: For hee doth not onely foreknowe, and foreſee all whatſoeuer, but alſo all thinges haue euer bene, are now, and euer ſhall bee ruled and gouerned by his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting forepoyntment. Neither doth hee at any tyme, that which he remembred not before, hee vſeth no after wittes, there is not in him any imperfections, hee hath no defectes, no paſſions, no forgetfulnes, no chaunge of diuiſe, no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of alteration. For albeit that by the generall flood hee deſtroyed all thinges (except the arke and all that was in it) yet hee made not any thing new in the World which was not made before.</p>
               <p>For hee excelleth man in wiſedome, goodnes and power: further then Man being a Potter can exceede his Earthen Pottes: who as a Creator of ſuch Pottes, may breake and deſtroy a nomber, and make as many new of another faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Euen ſo is God to man if it pleaſe him.</p>
